# Virtual_Mouse
As computer technology continues to develop, people have smaller and smaller electronic devices.
Increasingly we are recognizing the importance of human computing interaction (HCI), and in particular vision-based gesture and object recognition.
In our project, we propose a novel approach that uses a video device to control the mouse system (Mouse tasks).
